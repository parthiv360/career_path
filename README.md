### Our struggles on the Path.

While developing our website, we ran into some minor bugs like linking wrong urls to pages, and while connecting databases. We solved both of these errors with the help of stackoverflow and youtube videos. 

Another major problem we ran into was making the website responsive for different mobiles and tablets. We encountered a lot mis-orientations underneath our footer and on the margins. We overcame it through hardcoding media queries and sheer persevernce. 

Also finding reliable websites for information of collges and courses was a difficult task as our aim was to make our website highly trustworthy, so we took the help of some mentors and seniors from the educational field, who helped us immensely in providing information which is accurate. 

In this way we also learned the importance of research and how important quality is to any website. Also while deploying this website on heroku we faced some minor issues which we overcame with the help of youtube videos.
