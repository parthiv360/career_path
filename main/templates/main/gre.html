            <p>
                The Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) is a standardized test that is an admissions requirement for many graduate schools[7] in the United States and Canada[8] and few in other countries. The GRE is owned and administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS).[9] The test was established in 1936 by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.

          ABOUT GRE
        </h2>
        <h3 style="color: #199EB8;">
          1. Structure:-
        </h3>
        <h4>
            The computer-based GRE General Test consists of six sections. The first section is always the analytical writing section involving separately timed issue and argument tasks. The next five sections consist of two verbal reasoning sections, two quantitative reasoning sections, and either an experimental or research section. These five sections may occur in any order. The experimental section does not count towards the final score but is not distinguished from the scored sections. Unlike the computer adaptive test before August 2011, the GRE General Test is a multistage test, where the examinee's performance on earlier sections determines the difficulty of subsequent sections. This format allows the examined person to freely move back and forth between questions within each section, and the testing software allows the user to "mark" questions within each section for later review if time remains. The entire testing procedure lasts about 3 hours 45 minutes.[25][26] One-minute breaks are offered after each section and a 10-minute break after the third section.

The paper-based GRE General Test also consists of six sections. The analytical writing is split up into two sections, one section for each issue and argument task. The next four sections consist of two verbal and two quantitative sections in varying order. There is no experimental section on the paper-based test.

          2. Verbal section:-
        </h3>
        <h4>
            The computer-based verbal sections assess reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and vocabulary usage. The verbal test is scored on a scale of 130–170, in 1-point increments. (Before August 2011, the scale was 200–800, in 10-point increments.) In a typical examination, each verbal section consists of 20 questions to be completed in 30 minutes.[25] Each verbal section consists of about 6 text completion, 4 sentence equivalence, and 10 critical reading questions. The changes in 2011 include a reduced emphasis on rote vocabulary knowledge and the elimination of antonyms and analogies. Text completion items have replaced sentence completions and new reading question types allowing for the selection of multiple answers were added.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h3 style="color: #199EB8;">
          3. Quantitative section:-
        </h3>
        <h4>
            The computer-based quantitative sections assess basic high school level mathematical knowledge and reasoning skills. The quantitative test is scored on a scale of 130–170, in 1-point increments (Before August 2011 the scale was 200–800, in 10-point increments). In a typical examination, each quantitative section consists of 20 questions to be completed in 35 minutes.[25] Each quantitative section consists of about 8 quantitative comparisons, 9 problem solving items, and 3 data interpretation questions. The changes in 2011 include the addition of numeric entry items requiring the examinee to fill in the blank and multiple-choice items requiring the examinee to select multiple correct responses.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h3 style="color: #199EB8;">
          4. Analytical writing section:-
        </h3>
        <h4>
            The analytical writing section consists of two different essays, an "issue task" and an "argument task". The writing section is graded on a scale of 0–6, in half-point increments. The essays are written on a computer using a word processing program specifically designed by ETS. The program allows only basic computer functions and does not contain a spell-checker or other advanced features. Each essay is scored by at least two readers on a six-point holist scale. If the two scores are within one point, the average of the scores is taken. If the two scores differ by more than a point, a third reader examines the response.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h3 style="color: #199EB8;">
          5. Fees:-
        </h3>
        <h4>
            Starting October 2020, ETS has raised the GRE® General Test Fee from US $205 to US $213. Candidates registering from India, after October 7, 2020, would be required to pay the new GRE Registration Fee of US $213. All other fees including changing of GRE Test Centre and Rescheduling of the GRE exam remain unchanged.
